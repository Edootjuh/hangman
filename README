The classic game of Hangman written in Haskell for console.

The heart of the game is in the `turn` function. When given a `State` and a
character it will either return a new `State` with `Okay` as condition or the
old `State` with another `Condition` (error message).

I copied the English word list from /usr/share/dict on my system. It came from
cracklib, which comes by default in Arch Linux's core repo. The Dutch word list
comes from OpenTaal (http://www.opentaal.org/).
