The classic game of Hangman written in Haskell for console.

I copied the English word list from /usr/share/dict on my system. It came from

comes from OpenTaal (http://www.opentaal.org/).

I had help on StackExchange Code Review: http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/18497/hangman-is-this-small-haskell-game-clean-and-idiomatic-haskell-code
